#### Research summary

This study investigates how climate change will influence temperature-related deaths in European cities from 2015 to 2099. It focuses on the balance between heat-related and cold-related mortality under various socioeconomic, climate, and adaptation scenarios. The findings indicate that increases in heat-related deaths will outweigh any reductions in cold-related deaths, leading to a net rise in temperature-related mortality across most of Europe.

In the worst-case scenario (SSP3-7.0), where there is minimal mitigation and adaptation, the cumulative death toll due to climate change could exceed 2.3 million by the end of the century. Even with significant efforts to adapt to heat (reducing risk by 50%), this trend remains, particularly in vulnerable regions like Southern Europe. Northern Europe might see a slight net reduction in deaths, but this effect diminishes with time and under more severe warming scenarios.

The study emphasizes the importance of strong climate mitigation policies and robust adaptation strategies. Without these measures, many European cities, especially those in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe, are at risk of a substantial increase in mortality due to rising temperatures.

#### App

This app lets you explore the study results using an interactive map and table. The map shows how projected mortality outcomes vary across different locations. You can look at the results by global warming levels or five-year time periods (with the year selected being the start of the period), and zoom in on cities, countries, or regions.

The study analyzed the effects of cold and heat separately, as well as their distinct impacts on different age groups. The interactive controls let you view any combination of these cases. You can also use the toggles to adjust the scenario conditions under which the projections were generated.

Some technical terms related to the outcomes and scenarios are defined below.

#### Glossary

##### Mortality outcomes

- **Excess deaths:** The number of deaths attributable to temperature, calculated by comparing observed conditions to optimal temperature ranges.
- **Attributable fraction (%):** The percentage of total deaths that can be attributed to temperature.
- **Rate (x10‚Åµ) :** The mortality burden normalized to the population, typically expressed as deaths per 100,000 person-years.
- **Cumulative excess deaths:** The total number of temperature-attributed deaths accumulated over a specific period, until the selected year.

##### Scenario Components

- **Adaptation:** Strategies to reduce vulnerability to heat-related mortality, quantified as a percentage reduction in risk.
- **SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways):** Scenarios outlining future socioeconomic and environmental trajectories:
  - **SSP1-2.6:** A sustainable, equitable scenario with strong climate action.
  - **SSP2-4.5:** A middle-of-the-road scenario with moderate progress.
  - **SSP3-7.0:** A fragmented world with minimal action on climate and adaptation.
- **More scenario components:** Taking into account:
  - **Climate change:** Impacts from temperature changes alone.
  - **Demographic change:** Impacts from population shifts, such as aging or urbanization.
  - **Both:** Combined effects of climate and demographic changes.
