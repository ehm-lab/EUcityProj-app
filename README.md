# Shiny-app to visualise the results of Masselot et al. (2024)

This web-app lets you explore the projection results using an interactive map and table. The map shows how projected mortality outcomes vary across different locations. You can look at the results by global warming levels or time periods, and zoom in on cities, countries, or regions.

The study analyzed the effects of cold and heat separately, as well as their distinct impacts on different age groups. The interactive controls let you view any combination of these cases. You can also use the toggles to adjust the scenario conditions under which the projections were generated.

On runnning the app locally:
The large data files used as the source of data for the map and table are not committed to this repository, and so it is not possible to download the app as a stand-alone package. Please contact the maintainer for more information.
